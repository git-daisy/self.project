# Watch Me Grow! 
#### I created this webpage hub to navigate through my projects new and old as a practice sheet for me, and your viewing pleasure. 
#### Creator : git-daisy

## Technologies Used :

* HTML  
* CSS 
* Visual Studio Code 
* Github
* Terminal 

#### Description :
This webpage was created to demonstrate what I have learned in my first few weeks at Epicodus, it includes 1 img,  1 .html file with 3 internal links to other webpages and some styling with CSS! Initially
I wanted to use boostrap to help design my webpage- but decided to really try to internalize the basics of the two programs at hand. I struggled quite a bit to get my page 
laid out properly, and eventually ran out of time. I am excited to implement even more features into my project and get to know these programs even more, I feel like I have a much better grasp on how to use Github now that I've spent so much more time with it!
